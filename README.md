# ðŸŽ“ Govt of KP | Education Monitoring and Data Analytics (KPEMA)


A comprehensive data analysis project conducted under the Education Monitoring Authority (KPEMA), Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (GoKP). This work supports evidence-based education policy through school census evaluation, financial analysis, BISE result performance, and teacher workforce review.

## Project Highlights

- **Analyzed 27,900+ public schools** using Annual School Census data
- Conducted **student flow efficiency analysis** (Prep to Grade 10)
- Mapped and evaluated **non-functional schools** in settled and merged districts
- Tracked **per-student cost trends (2018â€“2023)** using government financial data
- Performed **district-wise BISE result analysis (2022â€“2024)** and flagged zero-pass schools
- Reviewed **teacher retirement and qualification** data to inform workforce planning

## Key Challenges Identified

- Security and access issues in remote/conflict-prone districts (e.g., Kurram, South Waziristan)
- Budget limitations and delayed release of non-salary operational funds
- Terrain and infrastructure limitations affecting school accessibility and field monitoring

## Tools & Techniques

- Microsoft Excel (data wrangling, statistical summaries)
- PowerPoint (policy insight presentation)
- Government datasets (Education Census, Finance, BISE)

## Project Impact

Findings and recommendations from this project were used to:
- Propose creation of a centralized KPEMA data center
- Support resource reallocation and school infrastructure planning
- Improve education outcomes through system-wide monitoring and evaluation
